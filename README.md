## What is this?

Kairos is a research-to-production trading platform being built from first principles:

* **Skin-in-the-game:** all logic is designed for live deployment with real capital.  
* **Audit-ready:** deterministic logs and nightly hash-chains.  
* **Asset-agnostic:** crypto first (no employer restrictions), but abstractions will support equities/REITs next.

See `docs/FOUNDATION.md` for the governing charter, operating principles, and roadmap.
